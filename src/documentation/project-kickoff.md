# Team name
## Project Title
By Jacob Marison and Gabe Lazatin

## Pitch
-

## Player and problem statement
- Our goal is to design a 2D top-down modular, scalable roguelite dungeon crawler. Our primary audience is towards fans of dungeon style games like the Legend of Zelda and the Binding of Isaac. 

## Core goals and top tasks
- Our core goal is replayability. Through generation of dungeons, random weapons and items, and varying enemies/bosses the player will have a new experience with each playthrough. Designed to be around 15 minute long and geared towards players who enjoy optimization (Min/Maxxing). 
- Player tasks
    - Clear rooms by killing all enemies and avoiding their attacks
    - Collect weapons and items to become stronger
    - Become strong enough to beat the dungeon boss
    - 

## Initial Specification
    - Core Features (MVP)
        - Modular weapons system
        - Stackable/Scalable items that impact either the player, enemies, or the player's weapon
    - Non-goals

    - Contraints
